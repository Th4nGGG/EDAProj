Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualisation on Ames housing dataset

The project aims at finding interesting rationales behind houses prices, using a popular data set for data science purpose â€“ the Ames housing dataset. Additionally, a linear model will also be constructed based on the findings.
The process of the project can be described as:
  1.	Deal with problems with the raw data 
  2.	Exploration of variables and their relationship with house prices
  3.	Significant findings in the dataset
  4.	Build a linear model
  5.	Discussion and recommendation

Dataset: The Ames housing dataset includes 80 variables (37 quantitative and 43 qualitative) which individually describe the features of sold properties in Ames from 2006 to 2010. It is considered one of the most popular dataset for data mining practices on Kaggle

Process: Data preprocessing & cleaning -> EDA -> Model -> Evaluation -> Recommendation
